This project is designed to work with Python 3.5. It requires that peewee be installed on the system, which can be installed using pip (see documentation link below). 

To run the project, navigate to the app folder and run main.py.

Deliverables for Part 1 of the Assignment are located in the Documents Folder.

The code is located in the app folder.

A test database is included, but to create a new database (one is included already) run db_init.py.
